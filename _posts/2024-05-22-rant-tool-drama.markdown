RANT ISSUE NO. 2

Date: 2024-05-22 10:00

There is nothing I find more annoying than being in a situation where I need some sort of customization of a corporate tool that I'm obligated to use and then be told, "Sorry, can you prove to us that this will improve efficiency for other users?".

It’s like asking for a receipt during a cash deal – you just aren’t going to get it.

Yes, I hate to break it to you, but the very "tools" department that’s supposed to support your workflow, are the ones throwing up roadblocks.

Since when does one need to conform to the tool’s way of doing things? If a new workflow, template, or field is needed to get work done, wouldn’t you think there’d be universal support for a universal corporate tool? Nope! 

Enter spreadsheets. You don’t need to open a ticket with the tools department to get things done. It can do all that you want it to do create graphs, make calculations, file your income tax returns... well, not quite, but you get the point.

Look, we need tools to adapt to our workflow, not the other way around. That’s why, no matter what happens, handy spreadsheet programs are always there. 

Dealing with tool departments is as unavoidable as rush hour traffic, and the solutions they provide come and go like the latest avocado fad diets. 

The one thing you can always rely on to get things done is a spreadsheet, and that’s something you can truly excel at.
